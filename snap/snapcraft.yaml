  Millions of people use Signal every day for free and instantaneous communication anywhere in the world. Send and receive high-fidelity messages, participate in HD voice/video calls, and explore a growing set of new features that help you stay connected. Signal's advanced privacy-preserving technology is always enabled, so you can focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to you.

  - Say anything - State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (powered by the open source Signal Protocolâ„¢) keeps your conversations secure. Privacy isn't an optional mode; it's just the way that Signal works. Every message, every call, every time.
  - Go fast - Messages are delivered quickly and reliably, even on slow networks. Signal is optimized to operate in the most constrained environment possible.

  - Speak up - Whether they live across town or across the ocean, Signal's enhanced audio and video quality will make your friends and family feel closer.
  - Whisper in the shadows - Switch to the dark theme if you refuse to see the light.
